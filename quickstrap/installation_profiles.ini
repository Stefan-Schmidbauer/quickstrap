# Quickstrap Installation Profiles Configuration
#
# This file configures how your application will be installed.
# Uncomment and modify the values below to match your project.

[metadata]
# REQUIRED: Display name of your application
app_name = My Application

# REQUIRED: Command to start your application
# Examples:
#   python3 src/main.py
#   python3 -m myapp
#   python3 app.py --config production
start_command = python3 main.py

# OPTIONAL: Message shown after successful installation
after_install = Start with: ./start.sh (Linux) or start.bat (Windows)


# Installation Profiles
# You can define multiple profiles for different installation scenarios
# Examples: minimal, standard, full, development, production

[profile:standard]
name = Standard Installation
description = Complete installation with all features
# Comma-separated list of features (used by your app to check what's installed)
# Examples: gui,pdf,database,printing,api,web,cli
features = gui,database

# REQUIRED: Files containing package requirements
python_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_python.txt
system_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_system.txt

# OPTIONAL: Pre-installation scripts to run (comma-separated)
# These scripts run BEFORE the virtual environment is created.
# Use them to verify system requirements (e.g., GPU drivers, hardware, etc.)
# If a script fails, the user can choose to continue or abort.
# pre_install_scripts = quickstrap/scripts/check_nvidia_driver.sh

# OPTIONAL: Post-installation scripts to run (comma-separated)
# These scripts run AFTER Python packages are installed.
# post_install_scripts = quickstrap/scripts/init_database.sh,quickstrap/scripts/check_deps.sh


# Example: Minimal Profile (uncomment to use)
# [profile:minimal]
# name = Minimal Installation
# description = Minimal installation without optional features
# features = cli
# python_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_python.txt
# system_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_system.txt


# Example: Development Profile (uncomment to use)
# [profile:development]
# name = Development Installation
# description = Full installation with development tools
# features = gui,database,testing,linting
# python_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_python.txt
# system_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_system.txt
# post_install_scripts = quickstrap/scripts/setup_dev_environment.sh

# Example: CUDA Profile with GPU check (uncomment to use)
# [profile:cuda]
# name = CUDA Installation
# description = Installation with GPU acceleration support
# features = gpu,cuda,ai
# python_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_python_cuda.txt
# system_requirements = quickstrap/requirements_system.txt
# pre_install_scripts = quickstrap/scripts/check_nvidia_driver.sh
# post_install_scripts = quickstrap/scripts/verify_cuda.sh
